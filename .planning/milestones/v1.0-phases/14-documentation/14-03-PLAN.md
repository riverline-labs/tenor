<objective>
Update README.md to reflect Tenor v1.0 completion. The current README is significantly behind — it says "Pre-alpha", "v0.3", has inaccurate CLI commands, and missing crates/features.

The README should accurately represent the state of the project: 72/72 conformance tests, five domain contracts validated, System construct elaborating and analyzing, static analysis suite, contract evaluator, all implemented.
</objective>

<context>
@README.md (current — outdated)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update README.md to v1.0 status</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md comprehensively. Key changes:

1. **Status:** Change "Pre-alpha" / "v0.3" to reflect v1.0 completion. The language, elaborator, evaluator, and static analyzer are complete and validated. Five domain contracts proven across real industries.

2. **Example:** Keep the escrow example (it's good) but verify it's valid .tenor syntax. Consider whether a shorter, punchier example works better, or keep current one.

3. **CLI commands:** Fix inaccuracies. Per CLAUDE.md, the correct commands are:
   - `cargo run -p tenor-cli -- test conformance` (NOT `run conformance`)
   - `cargo run -p tenor-cli -- elaborate path/to/file.tenor`
   - `cargo run -p tenor-cli -- validate path/to/bundle.json`
   - `cargo run -p tenor-cli -- check path/to/file.tenor` (static analysis)
   Add `tenor check` — this is a major feature the README doesn't mention.

4. **Repository structure:** Update to include all current crates:
   - core/ — elaboration pipeline
   - cli/ — command-line tool
   - eval/ — contract evaluator
   - analyze/ — static analysis (S1-S8)
   - codegen/ — code generation (scaffold)
   - lsp/ — Language Server Protocol (scaffold)
   Also add:
   - domains/ — validated domain contracts (saas, healthcare, supply_chain, energy_procurement, trade_finance, system_scenario)
   - conformance/ — elaborator conformance suite (72 tests)
   - docs/ — specification and guides

5. **Constructs table:** Add System construct. It's an eleven-construct language now (or however many the current spec defines). Verify the count.

6. **New section — Domain Contracts:** Brief mention that five real-world domain contracts ship with the repo, validated end-to-end. Link to docs/guide/author-guide.md for the full treatment.

7. **New section or link — Documentation:** Link to:
   - docs/guide/author-guide.md — for contract authors
   - docs/guide/what-is-tenor.md — for decision makers
   - docs/TENOR.md — formal specification

8. **Evaluation section:** Update to reflect that the evaluator is implemented and working, not just described.

9. **License:** Keep Apache 2.0.

Keep the README focused and not too long. It's a landing page, not documentation.

Verify accuracy of all CLI commands by running them:
```
cargo run -p tenor-cli -- test conformance 2>&1 | tail -5
cargo run -p tenor-cli -- elaborate conformance/positive/escrow_contract.tenor 2>&1 | head -5
cargo run -p tenor-cli -- check domains/supply_chain/inspection.tenor 2>&1 | head -10
```
Verify the example .tenor block in the README actually elaborates cleanly.
