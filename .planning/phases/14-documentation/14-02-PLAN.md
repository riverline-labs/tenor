<objective>
Create the one-page explainer (docs/guide/what-is-tenor.md) for decision makers — procurement leads, compliance officers, CTOs evaluating adoption.

No code. No syntax. Plain prose. Under 800 words.
</objective>

<context>
@docs/TENOR.md (reference for S1-S8 properties — translate to plain English)
@docs/guide/author-guide.md (sibling document — do not duplicate content)
</context>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create the one-page explainer</name>
  <files>docs/guide/what-is-tenor.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/guide/what-is-tenor.md`.

For decision makers. No code. No syntax. Plain prose.

**Opening paragraph:** The fragmentation problem in one sentence. The Tenor answer in one sentence.

**Three paragraphs:**

1. What Tenor guarantees — the S1-S8 properties in plain English.
   "We can prove no unauthorized user can release a payment. We don't test for it — the language makes it impossible to write a contract where it could happen."

2. What Tenor produces — the provenance chain.
   "Every decision carries its complete derivation. The audit trail is a mathematical theorem, not a log file."

3. What Tenor enables — independent auditability.
   "A regulator can run your contract through their own system and verify your outputs match. The contract is the specification anyone can check."

**Close** with honest scope: Tenor describes the behavioral contract. Building the application on top of it is still engineering work. But the behavioral layer — who can do what, under what conditions, with what guarantees — is formally specified and verifiable.

**Tone:** Direct. No hedging on formal verification claims — they are true, state them directly. No marketing language. No buzzwords.

Must contain ZERO code blocks. This is prose only.
  </action>
  <verify>File exists, no code blocks present, under 800 words, covers all three paragraph topics.</verify>
  <done>One-page explainer complete for decision makers.</done>

<verification>
1. docs/guide/what-is-tenor.md exists
2. Zero code blocks (no ``` markers)
3. Under 800 words
4. Three topics covered: guarantees, provenance, auditability
5. Honest scope section present
6. No technical jargon that requires programming knowledge

<success_criteria>
- Document is accessible to non-technical decision makers
- No code, no syntax, pure prose
- S1-S8 properties explained without formal notation
- Honest about scope — what Tenor does and doesn't do
</success_criteria>
