# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** A contract authored in TenorDSL must be statically verifiable, evaluable against facts, and generatable into working code -- the full lifecycle from specification to execution with provenance at every step.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Spec Completion

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Spec Completion)
Plan: 1 of 5 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-21 -- Plan 01-01 complete (Persona CFFP + spec section)

Progress: [#.........] 2%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 11min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Spec Completion | 1 | 11min | 11min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (11min)
- Trend: baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CFFP required for SPEC-01, SPEC-02, SPEC-03 before any implementation
- Domain validation (Phase 5) is a hard gate before code generation (Phase 6)
- Spec frozen after Phase 1 -- no language changes during tooling phases
- Persona is a pure identity token (no metadata, no delegation) -- CFFP Candidate A selected
- Persona section placed as Section 8 in TENOR.md, renumbering all subsequent sections
- Persona references in interchange remain as validated strings (parallels fact_ref pattern)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Requirements count: traceability table has 66 entries but REQUIREMENTS.md states 62. Actual count is 66. Updated during roadmap creation.
