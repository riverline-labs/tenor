## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CFFP required for SPEC-01, SPEC-02, SPEC-03 before any implementation
- Domain validation (Phase 5) is a hard gate before code generation (Phase 6)
- Spec frozen after Phase 1 -- no language changes during tooling phases

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Requirements count: traceability table has 66 entries but REQUIREMENTS.md states 62. Actual count is 66. Updated during roadmap creation.
